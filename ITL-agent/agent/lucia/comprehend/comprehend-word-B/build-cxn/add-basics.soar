# Desc: Adds basic attributes to a new construction.
#
#   This operator is intended to be selected
#   in a substate under build-cxn, but it ignores
#   build-cxn and works with everything
#   on the comprehend-word superstate.
#

#    Propose an operator to add basics to a new construction
sp {build-cxn*propose*add-basics
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>

         ^operator <ss-o>
         ^cxn <cxn>)
   (<cxn> ^cxn-name <name>)
