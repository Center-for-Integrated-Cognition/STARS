//	COMPLEX GROUNDING SCHEMAS
//	Rosie objects will be grounded to the world.
//  Known objects will be looked up in smem.
//	Some objects will be both RosieObjects
//	and KnownObjects. For these, first an attempt
//	is made to ground to the world, and if that
//	fails a lookup in smem is attempted.
//	If both fail, a new-object-id is created.
