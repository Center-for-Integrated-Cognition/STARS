############################# learn-subtask-proposal #########################

Will take a smem representation of a subtask operator and create an instance
  by matching it against the task-operator and world
  It then will propose that operator to the superstate and learn a chunk


##### State Rep ######

task-concept-network - the smem representation of the parent action
subtask-tcn    - the smem representation of the subtask
task-operator - the parent task, elaborated from superstate.task-operator
world           - elaborated from superstate.world


##### instantiate-task-argument ######

For each argument on the subtask-tcn, try to ground it against the world/task-operator
  (see action/task-utils/instantiate-task-operator)


##### Operators #####

create-operator - creates the root of the subtask-operator and copies level1 attributes 
  (like op_name, task-handle)

create-operator-argument - Copies the result of each instantiate-task-argument onto the subtask-operator

complete-learn-subtask-proposal - Will propose the subtask-operator onto the superstate
  And learn a chunk
