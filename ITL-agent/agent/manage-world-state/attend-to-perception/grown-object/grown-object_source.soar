# First: check to see if there are any world objects
#    that are missing perception-obj's 
#    and whose belief volumes are contained inside the grown object
#
# This may indicate that multiple objects were merged during segmentation

# use intersect-command to see which belief objects 
#   intersect the grown perception object

source intersect-command.soar

# Then if any belief objects do intersect the grown object
#   and do not have their own perception-obj's 
# See how much they are contained by the grown percpetion object

source overlap-command.soar

### Finally, resolve the discrepancy by changing the world
# If a merged segmentation was detected, set the perception-id
#   of the merged object to be the same as the grown object
#   (indicating they share a single perception-obj)
# Otherwise update the pose to match the larger scale
