#
# These rules take a general representation of a task (from smem TCN)
# And generate a task-operator instantiation with connections to the world and reference task
#
# They fire if the following structures are on the state:
#   (state <s> ^instantiate-task-operator <ito>)
#   (<ito> ^general-task-rep <rep>     # The root smem LTI of the task to instantiate 
#          ^reference-task-op <tkop>   # The current task-operator to match arguments against
#          ^reference-tcn-proc <proc>  # The procedural LTI of the reference task's TCN
#          ^world <w>)                 # The world to match arguments against

# Will add (<ito> ^instantiation <tkop>) when finished

####################### instantiate-task-goal ###########################

# These rules take a general representation of a task's goal (from smem TCN)
# And generate a instantiation with connections to the world and reference task

# They fire if the following structures are on the state:
#   (state <s> ^instantiate-task-goal <ito>)
#   (<ito> ^general-goal-rep <rep>     # The root smem LTI of the goal to instantiate

####################### instantiate-task-argument ###########################
#
# These rules take a general representation of a task argument (from smem)
# And generate an argument instantiation with connections to the world and the reference task
#
# They fire if an instantiate-task-argument structure is on the state
# (Note that the references and world are on the state itself)
#   (state <s> ^instantiate-task-argument <ita>
