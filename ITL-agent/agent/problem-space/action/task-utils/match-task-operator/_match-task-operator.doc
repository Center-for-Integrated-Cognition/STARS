#                     match-task-operator 
# Used to match a task-operator against a set of other candidate task operators
# Note: These rules are chunking friendly (yay!)
# 
# Usage: create the following structure on a state
# (state <s> ^match-task-operator <mto>)
# (<mto> ^task-operator <o> # This is a task-operator representation
#        ^candidate-tasks <tasks>)
# (<tasks> ^candidate-task-operator <c1> <c2> ...) # Task operators to match against
# 
# Through a series of elaboration rules, the match-task-operator structure
#   will be elaborated with ^successful-match <cand-op> any candidate task operators that match
