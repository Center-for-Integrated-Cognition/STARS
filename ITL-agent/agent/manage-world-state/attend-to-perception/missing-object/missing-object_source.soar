#   The object should be visible but it is missing from perception

### Step 1: check to see if any new perception objects
#    have appeared that are contained in the belief volume
#
# This may indicate there was a tracking error and the id should be reassigned

# First use intersect-command to see which perception objects 
#   intersect the belief object

source intersect-command.soar

# Then if any perception objects do intersect the belief object
#   and are not linked to any existing world objects
# See how much they are contained by the belief object
# Also see if the belief object is contained by a perception object

source overlap-command.soar

# If we do find a new perception object that is contained inside the belief object
#   then tell the tracking system to link the two fragements together
#   via change-world-state.merge-perception-objects

source change-world-state.soar

# Alternatively, if the belief is contained by another larger perception object, 
#   change its perception-id to the new one (via change-world-state)

### Step 2: Check if the object is missing because of occlusion
# If occluded, set an occlusion flag on the object-info.status
#   which will remove the discrepancy
# If not occluded, delete the object from the world via change-world-state
