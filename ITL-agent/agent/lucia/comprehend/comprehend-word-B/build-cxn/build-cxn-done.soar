# Desc: After a construction has been completely built out,
#       mark it on the superstate so build-cxn will retract.
#
#   This operator is intended to be selected
#   in a substate under build-cxn, but it ignores
#   build-cxn and works with everything
#   on the comprehend-word superstate.
#

#    Propose an operator to publish a new construction
sp {build-cxn*propose*build-cxn-done
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>)
   (<ss> ^problem-space comprehend-word
         ^operator <ss-o>
         ^cxn <cxn>)
   (<ss-o> ^name build-cxn
           ^smem-cxn <smem-cxn>)
   (<smem-cxn> ^cxn-name <name>)
  -(<cxn> ^built true) #   Retract when this operator completed
-->
   (<s> ^operator <o> + <)  #   This should run only at the end of build-cxn
   (<o> ^name build-cxn-done
        ^type construction
        ^cxn <cxn>
        ^debug-info (concat |Add basic attributes to a '| <name> |' construction.|))
}

#   Mark the new construction as having been built
sp {build-cxn*apply*build-cxn-done
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>
              ^operator <o>)
   (<o> ^name build-cxn-done
        ^cxn <cxn>)

   #    Mark the construction as having been fully built
