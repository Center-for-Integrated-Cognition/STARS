# Desc: The first thing to do in the build-cxn substate is to
#       publish the construction on the comprehend-word state.
#
#   This operator is intended to be selected
#   in a substate under build-cxn, but it ignores
#   build-cxn and works with everything
#   on the comprehend-word superstate.
#

#    Propose an operator to publish a new construction
sp {build-cxn*propose*acquire-cxn
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>)
   (<ss> ^problem-space comprehend-word
         ^operator <ss-o>
        -^cxn ) #   Retract when this operator completed
   (<ss-o> ^name build-cxn
           ^smem-cxn <smem-cxn>)
   (<smem-cxn> ^cxn-name <name>)
-->
   (<s> ^operator <o> + >)  #   This should run only at the start of build-cxn
   (<o> ^name acquire-cxn
        ^type construction
        ^smem-cxn <smem-cxn>
        ^debug-info (concat |Post a '| <name> |' construction to the superstate.|))
}

#   Publish a new construction on the comprehend-word state
sp {build-cxn*apply*acquire-cxn
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>
              ^operator <o>)
   (<o> ^name acquire-cxn
        ^smem-cxn <smem-cxn>)
-->
   #    Publish the construction
   (<ss> ^cxn <smem-cxn>)
}

#   Publish a new lexical construction on the comprehend-word state
sp {build-cxn*apply*acquire-cxn*lexical
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>
              ^operator <o>)
