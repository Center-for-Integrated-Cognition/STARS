# find-projection is a query operator used to get a fixed coordinate for a projection
# of a learned predicate and set of objects
# Below is an example of a proposal for a find-projection operator

#sp {propose*find-projection
#   (state <s> -^projection-result)
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> + =)
#   (<o> ^name find-projection
#        ^arg-list <args>
#        ^predicate <pred>)
#   (<args> ^1 <arg1>
#           ^2 <arg2>)
#}

# This corresponds to the sentence "put <arg1> to the <pred> of <arg2>" where
# each <arg> corresponds to the top-state objects 
# and <pred> to the predicate lti for the relation

# The find-projection will add a ^projection-result WME to the calling state
# ^projection-result will contain ^x <x> ^y <y> ^z <z> when successful 
# otherwise ^projection-result will be failure
#
# additionally the failure reason will be added to the superstate
# ^proj-failure-reason << no-prep no-object >>
