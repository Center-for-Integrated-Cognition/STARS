# Desc: Adds a connection to the previous construction to a new construction.
#
#   This operator is intended to be selected
#   in a substate under build-cxn, but it ignores
#   build-cxn and works with everything
#   on the comprehend-word superstate.
#

#    Propose an operator to add a previous link to a new construction
