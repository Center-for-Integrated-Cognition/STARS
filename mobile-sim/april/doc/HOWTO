APRIL Robotics Toolbox (ART)
------------

The APRIL Robotics Toolbox is maintained by the APRIL Robotics
Laboratory at the University of Michigan, under the supervision of
Prof. Edwin Olson (ebolson@umich.edu).

The goal of this toolbox is to provide reusable software components
that can be used and relied upon by others. At this point in time, the
toolbox is brand new and so volatility should be expected.
